My projects:
- Jupyter Notebook Data Project: Python project which mainly utilizes pandas and yfinance for company data. Outcome of the project is a script which calculates FCFE and FCFF for a company with only the ticker symbol. Also the code allows the user to pick different growth scenarios for which DCF-calculations are performed. At the end a price is determined for the stock.
- Snake game: C++ and GUI (a university project)
